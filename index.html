              <p>The best way to interact with bots is to use the MaNGOSBot addon. Just select your bot and click the appropriate buttons. There are keybinding available such as commands to follow you, stop moving, attack etc. You do not need to do anything though - just invite bots to your group, command them to follow and the AI will take care for everything else.</p>

              <p>Bots are self-capable of doing usual WoW stuff, but the power of the mod is the chat commands you could use to tell bots what and how to to it. For example, you can tell them to start clearing the area of mobs while you doing something more interesting. Or command to go to a mailbox, check the mail and maybe send you some items or gold.</p>

              <p>The engine uses reactive AI so the bots watch for something happens and react by doing something. There are different ways how to react so calling strategies, and you can tell bots which one to use at the moment. For example, you can swith a warrior to be a tank or dps. A mage can use frost, fire or arcane rotations. A priest could a healer or a shadow dps. You can tell the bots how to buff players (increasing their dps, mana regen or maybe threat).</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Installation Guide</h2>

          <p>Installing mangosbot can be tricky but easy if you are famillar with the MaNGOS core itself. Basically you need to enable some settings during compilation and apply additional SQL files to your DB and add config files to your realm.</p>

          <div class="subheading mb-3">Workflow</div>
          <ul class="fa-ul mb-0">
            <li>
              <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
              Checkout the code from the appropriate branch depending on the game version you want to use. Theare are a little changes to the core itself, mostly some hook points to call the MaNGOSBot code. You can even checkout other version of the core and apply these changes manually (search of #ifdef ENABLE_PLAYERBOTS for more information).</li>
            <li>
              <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
              Update all submodules to the latest version. The references to submodules are usually outdated so it is a good idea to pull them manually so the latest version will be used. It is always compatible with the main code.</li>
            <li>
              <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
              Configure and build the code. Make sure to set ENABLE_PLAYERBOTS and ENABLE_IMMERSIVE to true.</li>
            <li>
              <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
              Apply SQL files from modules/Bots/sql and modules/Immersive/sql to the appropriate DBs (see file names such as characters_*.sql and world_*.sql)</li>
            <li>
              <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
              Configure AhBot, Immersive and MaNGOSBot by putting ahbot.conf, immersive.conf and aiplayerbot.conf to your config directory (where mangosd.conf is located). Feel free to change any value, although the default ones are fine too. This actually enables the features so the config files are mandatory.</li>
              <li>
                <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
                Run the server. The first run can be quite slow as a vast number of random characters will be created. It is recommended to init them all at once by running "rndbot init" console command, wait for it to complete and restart the server. If you do not run the server for more than couple days it is a good idea to repeat the initialization process again.</li>

            <p>MaNGOSBot is available as source code only. You need to build it using the appropriate tools for your platform.</p>

        <div class="my-auto">
          <h2 class="mb-5">How to play the game</h2>
          <p>Create your main character and a number of alts. As they will level simultaniously it is a good idea to create them early on. Log in the game as a main character.</p>
          <p>You'll notice than all your alts are staying near you ready to play. Invite them to your group and use MaNGOSBot Addon to customize their behaviour.</p>
          <p>It is recommended to assign some keyboard shortcuts to MaNGOSBot Addon key binding such as Follow, Stay, Attack, Flee etc to quickly command all your party to do something. Now make them follow you and go play the game!</p>
          <p>Grab a quest from a quest giver - your alts will grab it too. Start killing the mobs for the quest - your alts will help you: the tank will grab the aggro, the healer will heal, others will damage your targets, everyone will apply the needed buffs etc. They will loot the quest items if necessary and report to chat their progress with quests.</p>
          <p>If the quest requires to use some gameobjects you can ask bots to tell you all they see. Whisper:</p>
            <pre>los</pre>
          <p>This will print you a lot of links: all game object, units, npcs, players etc. nearby. Choose the correct one and tell:
            <pre>u [gameobject]</pre>
            [gameobject] is the gameobject link, Shift-click the links provided by bot and it will be copied to the chat box.
            The bot willthen  use the object and trigger the quest required action.
          </p>
          <p>When the quest is done for everyone in your group, go to the quest giver and turn it in. The bots will turn the quest too and get the XP and the reward if available.</p>
          <p>If the quest has multiple rewards, you need to tell everyone what to choose. Just whisper to each player a command such as:
            <pre>r [item]</pre>
            [item] is a item link, Shift-click to the quest reward to copy it to the chat box. Then the bot will turn the quest in choosing this reward.
          </p>
          <p>When looting you'll notice that bots sometimes say to chat that the looted items could be useful in some way. They could equip it for instance. Or you may have an item useful for a bot or maybe they will have an item useful for you. It is time to exchange those items and equip something new. Just select a bot and click Inventory button on the MaNGOSBot Addon. Provided you installed EngBot addon the window will pop-up showing the bot's inventory the same way this addons shows yours. Use context menu to make the bot add the item to the trade window, to equip, to use, or even to destroy the items. You can give them your items and gold by trading.</p>
          <p>Alternative to the addon are the chat commands. You can find more information in latter pages on this guide, but in general you need to whisper commands such as (small text is the command description):
            <pre>u [item] <small>to <b>u</b>se this item</small></pre>
            <pre>e [item] <small>to <b>e</b>quip this item</small></pre>
            <pre>ue [item] <small>to <b>u</b>n<b>e</b>quip this item</small></pre>
            <pre>t [item] <small>to add the item to the <b>t</b>rade window</small></pre>
            <pre>b [item] <small>to <b>b</b>uy this item from a vendor nearby</small></pre>
            <pre>s [item] <small>to <b>s</b>ell this item</small></pre>
            <pre>destroy [item] <small>to destroy the item</small></pre>
          </p>
          <p>Now it is time to level up some skills and attributes. Go to the class trainer and start talking. The bots will whisper in chat what they could learn. Tell them:
            <pre>trainer learn</pre>
            And the bot will learn these skills.
          </p>
          <p>Buying attributes is done by talking to the npc. This is done using the <b>talk</b> command:</p>
              <pre>talk</pre>
          <p>And the bot will whisper you everything the NPC said to him. Note than options will have a numbers before them. Whisper:</p>
              <pre>talk 2</pre>
              2 - is the number of an option and the bot will choose this option and the conversation will go on. So you can buy the attributes now.
            </p>
          <p>You can learn this way any skills including weapons, crafting, spells etc.</p>
          <p>Hey, they have not enough gold to do so! Is it time to play the game and get some stuff to sell!</p>
          <p>Now it is time to craft something. Use MaNGOSBot Addon and click Spells button. The window will pop-up showing all craftable items that bot can craft. Just use context menu to craft it. They could create something useful for you too!</p>
          <p>Sometimes you need to check some information about the bot current stats, level etc. There are some commands available:
              <pre>stats <small>to see bot gold, XP, item durability</small></pre>
              <pre>who <small>to see bot overall information such as level, talents etc</small></pre>
              <pre>who [skill] <small>to see level of that skill, eg. skinning</small></pre>
              <pre>ready <small>to see overall bot readyness to fight</small></pre>
          </p>
          <p>Bored to do a group play? Then disband the party and play alone for some time. Is it usually a good idea to brind your alts near a mailbox or to make them stay at the inn (maybe using a hearthstone) before though. Do not worry: the bots will level up with you, so you won't outlevel them.</p>
          <p>The easiest way to disband the party is to whisper:
            <pre>leave</pre>
            in the group chat or use the MaNGOSBot addon. Note that if you leave the party, others will still remain in party without you and they will no t get any shared XP, rep, do quests etc. so this commands makes all bots to leave the party disbanding it.
          </p>
          <p>OK, now it is time to solo!</p>
          <p>Got something useful for others during solo play? Send it to your alts via a mailbox. Even if you are far away from them, whisper:
            <pre>mail ?</pre>
            Provided your alts were near a mailbox, they will show all their mail in chat. Again, note numbers before mails - they are used in mail commands:
            <pre>mail take 5 - <small>Take all items from mail number 5</small></pre>
            <pre>mail read 5 - <small>Read mail number 5</small></pre>
            <pre>mail delete 5 - <small>Delete mail number 5</small></pre>
            <pre>sendmail [item] - <small>Send [item] to you</small></pre>
            <pre>sendmail [item] [player] - <small>Send [item] to a specific [player]</small></pre>
          </p>
          <p>Did some leveling? Your alts needs it too! Summon them to use or ask them to summon you:
            <pre>summon</pre>
            Summoning player need to be near a meeting stone or an innkeeper to be able to do so. That's why you brought your alts to the inn!
          </p>
          <p>Maybe now it is time to go for a dungeon? Do not forget to grab the necessary quests or just share yours with bots.</p>
          <p>Happy playing!</p>
